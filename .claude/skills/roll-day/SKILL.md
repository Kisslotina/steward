description: The single daily routine — run once per day to roll Steward forward. Use when the user says "daily run", "start my day", "roll the day", "process today", "run Steward for today", or wants the day kicked off. Orchestrates five phases in order — close-out, sweep, sort, carry-forward, refresh — sweeping Today's free-text Daily notes into the Inbox and calling sort-inbox to classify them. Supersedes the retired sweep-daily-notes step. Registry-driven (bases.local.json); never deletes records.

# Roll Day

The single daily routine. Run once per day to roll Steward forward: record what got done, sweep new
Daily notes into the Inbox, sort them, carry undone work forward, and leave the `Today` page clean
for tomorrow. This routine **orchestrates** the day and **calls `sort-inbox`** for classification —
it never re-implements sorting. It supersedes the retired `sweep-daily-notes` step.

**Built to run on a small model.** Every phase except **sort** is mechanical — plain reads and
writes, no judgement. Only the **sort** phase needs reasoning, and that is delegated to `sort-inbox`.
Follow the numbered steps **literally and in order**; do not improvise, batch, or skip. When a step
says STOP, stop. If anything is ambiguous, do the safe thing named in the step and record it in the
run report rather than guessing.

`Today` is **one rolling page**, not a page per day. Its linked Tasks view is filtered
`Done = false AND Do date <= "today"` and grouped by Type, so undone past tasks resurface on their
own each day — carry-forward therefore needs **no date mutation**.

## Step 0 — load the base registry (no live Notion list query)
1. With your **file tools**, read the local registry **`bases.local.json`** (base name → ID),
   written by `bootstrap-notion`. This is the source of truth for which bases exist and their IDs.
2. Read these three keys — **no hardcoded IDs anywhere**:
   - **`Inbox`** — data-source ID; where swept lines are appended (the sort phase reads it).
   - **`Tasks`** — data-source ID; the day board behind `Today`, and the close-out source.
   - **`Today`** — a **page ID** (NOT a data-source ID); the rolling daily page to sweep and refresh.
3. If `bases.local.json` is missing, or the **`Today`** key is absent or empty, **STOP** and tell the
   user to run `bootstrap-notion` first. Never guess, search for, or hardcode the Today page or any ID.
4. `sort-inbox` reads `routing.md`, `taxonomy.md`, and `conventions.md` itself in Phase 3 — `roll-day`
   does not classify, so it does not need them here.

## Tools (Notion MCP) — use these exact tools
- `notion-fetch` — read a page or a data-source schema by ID (the `Today` page; confirm a base's
  property names if unsure). Read, never assume property spellings.
- `notion-create-pages` — create a new row. For an Inbox row, set the parent to the Inbox
  **data-source ID** from Step 0: `parent: { data_source_id: "<Inbox id>" }`. Never use a database
  URL or a `database_id`.
- `notion-update-page` — edit existing page content: prepend "✅ " to a swept Daily-notes line
  (Phase 2), and remove the "✅" lines at the end of the day (Phase 5).
This routine does not call `notion-search` — every ID comes from the registry in Step 0, and the sort
phase's reads belong to `sort-inbox`.

## Phases (run in order)
The day rolls through five phases. Do them strictly in sequence; each later phase assumes the earlier
one finished. Nothing here executes outbound work — see Rules.

### 1. close-out — record only (read-only, no writes)
The `Today` board is a **live linked view of Tasks**, so a task ticked there has **already** updated
its Tasks row to `Done` — there is nothing to write back. This phase only **records** today's
completed tasks for the run report / audit log.
1. `notion-fetch` the `Today` page once and keep its content in memory for Phases 2 and 5 (do not
   re-fetch it each phase). Read the tasks shown as done today: `Done = true` with a `Do date` of today.
2. List their titles and count them for the report.
3. **Write nothing.** Do not re-close, re-check, or edit these rows — no double-close.

### 2. sweep — Daily notes → Inbox, then mark the source line "✅"
Move the free-text Daily notes into the Inbox so the sort phase can process them. Work **one line at
a time, in order**, and **keep a running list of the Inbox `page_id`s you create** — Phase 3 hands
that list to `sort-inbox`:
1. From the `Today` content read in Phase 1, look only under the `## 📝 Daily notes` heading. List
   each free-text line there that does **not** already start with "✅". Skip any line that already
   starts with "✅" (it was swept on an earlier run).
2. For the next unmarked line, `notion-create-pages` **one** Inbox row:
   `parent: { data_source_id: "<Inbox id>" }`, `Note` = the line text, `Status` = `New`.
   Record the returned `page_id` in the swept-ids list.
3. Confirm the create returned a page ID. Then **immediately** `notion-update-page` that source line
   on `Today` to prepend "✅ " to its text.
4. Only after the line is marked "✅", move to the next line. Repeat 2–4 until no unmarked lines remain.

The "✅" mark is the **only** dedup guard. If an Inbox row was created but its source line **cannot be
marked** "✅", **STOP immediately and report** which line — do not continue. (Otherwise the next run
re-imports it and duplicates the Inbox row.)

### 3. sort — invoke sort-inbox (process the WHOLE `New` backlog)
Invoke **`sort-inbox`**, passing the **swept `page_id`s from Phase 2 as its hint list** so it need
not rediscover them. **Its scope is still fixed and unambiguous: every Inbox row whose `Status = New`**
— the lines just swept **plus every earlier unsorted `New` capture** (e.g. notes the phone shortcut
added on previous days). Process **all** `New` rows and nothing else (a `Sorted` row is already done).

**Do not ask the user which items, or which subset, to sort, and never narrow to "just today's
swept lines."** `Status = New` already defines the scope completely.

`sort-inbox` owns classification, routing, completion-vs-new, and archiving filed rows to **Inbox
Archive** — **do not re-implement any of it here**. The default-date rule also lives there: a swept
task with no date gets `Do date = today`, `Tag = Triage`, so it lands on today's board. See
`.claude/skills/sort-inbox/SKILL.md`. Wait for it to finish before Phase 4.

### 4. carry-forward — do nothing to dates (verify only)
Undone past tasks **resurface on their own**: the Today board filters `Done = false AND Do date <=
today`, so anything still open with a past `Do date` is already shown. **Do not touch dates** —
**preserve each task's original `Do date`** as a slippage signal (how long it has been overdue).
`notion-fetch` the board only to **count** the overdue (carried) tasks for the report. Make no writes.

### 5. refresh — clear the captured lines from Today
Only **after** Phase 2 confirmed every swept line reached the Inbox, `notion-update-page` the `Today`
page to remove the "✅" lines from the `## 📝 Daily notes` area, leaving that area empty for the new
day. Do **not** remove an unmarked line (it was never swept). `Today` is **one rolling page** — never
create a dated or per-day page. Leave the linked Tasks view untouched; it refreshes itself from the
relative-date filter.

## Rules
- **Registry-driven.** Resolve `Inbox`, `Tasks`, and the `Today` page ID from `bases.local.json` —
  no invented names, no hardcoded IDs. Missing registry or absent `Today` key → STOP and point the
  user to `bootstrap-notion`.
- **Calls `sort-inbox`** for classification — never re-implements sorting, routing, completion, or
  archiving logic. Passes the swept `page_id`s as a hint; `New` remains the authoritative scope.
- **Scope of the sort phase is exactly `Status = New`.** Process every `New` Inbox row — the whole
  backlog, not only the lines swept this run. Never pause to ask which records to sort.
- **Never delete database records.** The only thing ever removed is transient "✅" free-text lines on
  the `Today` page, and only **after** they are safely in the Inbox (Phase 5 follows a verified Phase 2).
  Filed Inbox rows are **moved** to Inbox Archive by `sort-inbox`, never deleted.
- **Never perform outbound work.** Anything outbound is enqueued as an **Outbox** row with a
  `Handler` (`Concierge Gateway` for notifications, `Steward (MCP)` for connector actions); the
  executor routine or the Gateway runs it. `roll-day` does not act directly.
- **One rolling page.** Sweep and refresh operate on the single `Today` page; never create per-day pages.
- **One line at a time.** In sweep, create the Inbox row, record its id, verify it, mark "✅", then
  move on. A line that cannot be marked halts the run (Phase 2).

## Output (run report)
Report, for this run:
- **close-out** — today's completed/closed tasks recorded (count + titles).
- **sweep → sort** — lines swept into Inbox and handed to `sort-inbox` (count); per-item outcomes
  (filed / closed / enqueued to Outbox / Not Recognized / moved to Inbox Archive) come from
  `sort-inbox`'s own report.
- **carry-forward** — overdue tasks carried (count).
- **errors / skips** — any line that could not be marked "✅" (and where the run stopped), a missing
  registry / `Today` key, or any failed write.
