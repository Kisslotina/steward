# Data model (Notion)

Concise schema reference. Full rationale in `architecture.md` (sections 4–5a). Keep names in sync
with `.claude/rules/conventions.md`.

## Capture

### Inbox
| Field | Type | Values |
|---|---|---|
| Note | Title | captured text |
| Date | Created time | auto |
| Type | Select | task · reminder · reference · goal · thought · event · expense · purchase · unsure (set by Steward) |
| Status | Select | New → Sorted |
| Target | Text | where it was filed (audit) |

Second capture surface: free-text **Daily notes** on the `Today` page (swept into Inbox by
`sweep-daily-notes`).

## Typed bases (PARA)

| Base | Key fields | Relations |
|---|---|---|
| Areas DB | Area (title), Notes | ← Goals, Projects, Content Ideas |
| Goals | Goal, Horizon (Yearly/Short-term), Target date, Status, Notes | → Area ; ← Projects |
| Projects | Project, Status (Backlog/Active/On hold/Done), Deadline, Summary | → Area, → Goal ; ← Tasks |
| Tasks | Task, Done, Do date, Priority, Type (Work/Personal), Tag, Assignee, Executor (Me/Auto) | → Project |
| Content Ideas | Idea, Platform, Status (New/In progress/Drafted/Posted), Notes | → Area (optional) |
| Reviews | Period (title), Date + text columns: Health/Sport/Career/Work/Money/Family | wide format, no relations |
| Knowledge / Tech notes | reference facts | create on first `reference` |

**Canonical Area vocabulary:** Career · Health · Sport · Money · Family · Content · Other.

**Hierarchy:** Area ⊃ Goal ⊃ Project ⊃ Task (every level above Task is optional).

## Dead-letter

### Not Recognized
| Field | Type | Values |
|---|---|---|
| Note | Title | unrecognized text |
| Reason | Text | why Steward was unsure |
| Status | Select | Open → Resolved |
| Source | Select | Inbox voice / Daily notes |
| Date | Created time | auto |

## Outbox — outbound queue (two consumers)

Single queue of outbound work the sort routine enqueues. **Two** consumers read it, each picking
the rows assigned to it via `Handler`:

- **Steward (MCP)** — a Claude **executor routine** that runs connector actions (Google Calendar,
  Docs, Sheets, other) natively via MCP. The LLM + native connectors handle these better than a
  plain microservice.
- **Concierge Gateway** — the always-on Node.js service, scoped to Telegram (posting
  logs/notifications, and later receiving incoming taps) — the part Claude can't do natively/24-7.

| Field | Type | Values |
|---|---|---|
| Item | Title | short description of the message/action |
| Type | Select | notify · calendar · doc · sheet · other |
| Handler | Select | Steward (MCP) · Concierge Gateway |
| Payload | Text | params/details (text to send, event fields, …) |
| Status | Select | Queued → Done (→ Failed) |
| Source | Text | which Inbox/record spawned it (audit) |
| Date | Created time | auto |

Flow: sort routine writes `Status=Queued` with a `Handler` → the matching consumer reads its Queued
rows → performs the action → sets `Done` (or `Failed`). Default routing: `notify` →
Concierge Gateway; `calendar/doc/sheet/other` → Steward (MCP). This replaces the earlier "Actions"
table. Two-way approvals, if needed later, extend a row with an approval status.
